These files are for use with PlaneEd or Captain PlaneEd. 

PlaneEd: Place PlaneEd.exe in this folder
(you might need to copy SDL.dll here as well),
and simply drag and drop a .txt file onto PlaneEd.exe to start it.

Captain PlaneEd offers an "open file" dialog instead and adds
some more user friendliness in general.

You can find PlaneEd and more info at: http://info.sonicretro.org/PlaneED

*Note:* all files using the "Palette Destination Offset" offset, so in 
particular all bgchunk_*.txt projects, need a new version of Captain PlaneEd
from Apr 23, 2016 (commit f3c8485) or later (likely >=v1.0.2 in the future).
